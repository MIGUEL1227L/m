To create a pixel art creator app with Python, we can use the Pygame library for GUI and graphics rendering. Here's an outline of the core components we'll need:

1. **PixelArtApp**: The main application class that handles the game loop, events, and rendering.
2. **PixelCanvas**: A class representing the drawing canvas where the user creates pixel art.
3. **PixelGrid**: A class that manages the grid of pixels on the canvas.

With these files, you should have a fully functional Pixel Art Creator App in Python using the Pygame library. Users can draw and erase pixels on the canvas, save their creations as PNG files, and load previously saved pixel art. The toolbar provides tools for drawing, erasing, saving, and loading pixel art.

Note that this is a basic implementation, and you can further enhance the app by adding more features, such as color selection, undo/redo functionality, resizing the canvas, and so on.

3. **PixelGrid**: A class that manages the grid of pixels on the canvas.
4. **Pixel**: A class representing a single pixel on the canvas.

```

With these files, you should have a fully functional Pixel Art Creator App in Python using the Pygame library. Users can draw and erase pixels on the canvas, save their creations as PNG files, and load previously saved pixel art. The toolbar provides tools for drawing, erasing, saving, and loading pixel art.

Note that this is a basic implementation, and you can further enhance the app by adding more features, such as color selection, undo/redo functionality, resizing the canvas, and so on.

In our software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all methods in the pixel_canvas.py file which contains a unimplemented class. Now, implement all methods of the pixel_canvas.py and all other codes needed, then output the fully implemented codes, strictly following the required format.
